# Cab-Sharing-and-Navigation-System
Travelling has become a very important and necessary component in our daily life to accomplish our task. There are several ways to travel along but they got some draw backs such as time delay, costly fair, long travelling route. So, our team developed a CAB SHARING AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM program which overcomes the drawback in such a way that reduces travelling distance by analysing all available routes, and selecting a route which has minimum distance to reach that particular pickup or drop-off points This Cab Sharing Service will be available at an affordable fair price which will be delivering each passenger in minimum time and distance by sharing a single cab.
